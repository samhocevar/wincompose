WinCompose
==========

![Icon](/web/icon.png)

A robust compose key for Windows, written by Sam Hocevar.

It allows to easily write characters such as **é ž à ō û ø ☺ ¤
∅ « ♯ ⸘ Ⓚ ㊷ ♪ ♬** using short and often very intuitive key
combinations. For instance, **ö** is obtained using **o** and **"**, and
**♥** is obtained using **<** and **3**.

After installation, WinCompose should appear in the System Tray;
otherwise, launch it manually:

Press and release the **Right Alt** key to initiate a compose sequence; the
icon should change to indicate a compose sequence is in progress:

Type in the keys for a compose sequence, such as **A** then **E** for **Æ**:

If **Right Alt** is not suitable for you, right click on the tray icon to
choose another key.

Examples
--------

Compose rules are supposed to be intuitive. Here are some examples:

 - **` a** → **à**
 - **' e** → **é**
 - **^ i** → **î**
 - **~ n** → **ñ**
 - **/ o** → **ø**
 - **" u** → **ü**
 - **o c** → **©**
 - **+ -** → **±**
 - **: -** → **÷**
 - **C C C P** → **☭**
 - **( 2 3 )** → **㉓**
 - **< 3** → **♥**

The full list of rules can be found in the `Compose.txt` file shipped with
WinCompose, or by clicking on the WinCompose system tray icon or using the
“Show Sequences…” menu entry:

The window allows you to filter the sequences being listed.

Features
--------

WinCompose supports the standard Compose file format. It ships with more than
1000 compose rules from [Xorg](http://www.x.org/wiki/).

WinCompose supports rules of more than 2 characters such as **( 3 )**
for **③**.

WinCompose supports early exits. For instance, **Compose &** will
immediately type **&** because there is currently no rule starting with **&**.

WinCompose does not emit unnecessary keystrokes, such as a backspace keystroke
to erase the composing characters. Only the final character is sent to the
current application.

Bugs
----

As of now, WinCompose does not support Unicode code points after U+FFFF.
