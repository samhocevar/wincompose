 WinCompose
==========

A compose key for Windows, free and open-source, created by Sam Hocevar.

A **compose key** allows to easily write special characters such as **é
ž à ō û ø ☺ ¤ ∅ « ♯ ⸘ Ⓚ ㊷ ♪ ♬** using short and often
very intuitive key combinations. For instance, **ö** is obtained using
<kbd>o</kbd> + <kbd>"</kbd>, and **♥** is obtained using <kbd>&lt;</kbd>
\+ <kbd>3</kbd>.

WinCompose also supports Emoji input for 😁 👻 👍 💩 🎁 🌹 🐊.

Quick start
-----------

After installation, WinCompose should appear in the System Tray. Press and
release the <kbd>⎄ Compose</kbd> key to initiate a compose sequence (this key
defaults to <kbd>Right Alt</kbd>); the icon should change to indicate a compose
sequence is in progress.

Then type in the keys for a compose sequence, such as <kbd>A</kbd> then
<kbd>E</kbd> for **Æ**:

If <kbd>Right Alt</kbd> is not suitable for you, you can change it in the options.

Examples
--------

Compose rules are supposed to be intuitive. Here are some examples:

 - <kbd>⎄ Compose</kbd> <kbd>\`</kbd> <kbd>a</kbd> → **à**
 - <kbd>⎄ Compose</kbd> <kbd>'</kbd> <kbd>e</kbd> → **é**
 - <kbd>⎄ Compose</kbd> <kbd>^</kbd> <kbd>i</kbd> → **î**
 - <kbd>⎄ Compose</kbd> <kbd>~</kbd> <kbd>n</kbd> → **ñ**
 - <kbd>⎄ Compose</kbd> <kbd>/</kbd> <kbd>o</kbd> → **ø**
 - <kbd>⎄ Compose</kbd> <kbd>"</kbd> <kbd>u</kbd> → **ü**
 - <kbd>⎄ Compose</kbd> <kbd>o</kbd> <kbd>c</kbd> → **©**
 - <kbd>⎄ Compose</kbd> <kbd>+</kbd> <kbd>-</kbd> → **±**
 - <kbd>⎄ Compose</kbd> <kbd>:</kbd> <kbd>-</kbd> → **÷**
 - <kbd>⎄ Compose</kbd> <kbd>(</kbd> <kbd>7</kbd> <kbd>)</kbd> → **⑦**
 - <kbd>⎄ Compose</kbd> <kbd>C</kbd> <kbd>C</kbd> <kbd>C</kbd> <kbd>P</kbd> → **☭**
 - <kbd>⎄ Compose</kbd> <kbd>&lt;</kbd> <kbd>3</kbd> → **♥**

Emoji sequences typically start with two <kbd>⎄ Compose</kbd> hits:

 - <kbd>⎄ Compose</kbd> <kbd>⎄ Compose</kbd> <kbd>a</kbd> <kbd>n</kbd> <kbd>g</kbd> <kbd>r</kbd> <kbd>y</kbd> → 😠
 - <kbd>⎄ Compose</kbd> <kbd>⎄ Compose</kbd> <kbd>g</kbd> <kbd>r</kbd> <kbd>i</kbd> <kbd>n</kbd> <kbd>n</kbd> <kbd>i</kbd> <kbd>n</kbd> <kbd>g</kbd> → 😁
 - <kbd>⎄ Compose</kbd> <kbd>⎄ Compose</kbd> <kbd>s</kbd> <kbd>u</kbd> <kbd>s</kbd> <kbd>h</kbd> <kbd>i</kbd> → 🍣
 - <kbd>⎄ Compose</kbd> <kbd>⎄ Compose</kbd> <kbd>s</kbd> <kbd>n</kbd> <kbd>a</kbd> <kbd>k</kbd> <kbd>e</kbd> → 🐍

A special Unicode input mode can be activated in the options and lets
the user type in any Unicode character:

 - <kbd>⎄ Compose</kbd> <kbd>u</kbd> <kbd>5</kbd> <kbd>8</kbd> <kbd>d</kbd> <kbd>Enter</kbd> → ֍ (U+058D Right-Facing Armenian Eternity Sign)
 - <kbd>⎄ Compose</kbd> <kbd>u</kbd> <kbd>2</kbd> <kbd>3</kbd> <kbd>f</kbd> <kbd>0</kbd> <kbd>Enter</kbd> → ⏰ (U+23F0 Alarm Clock)

The full list of rules can be found by clicking on the WinCompose system tray
icon or using the “Show Sequences…” menu entry:

The window allows you to filter the sequences being listed.

Features
--------

WinCompose supports the standard Compose file format. It provides more than
1700 compose rules from the [Xorg](http://www.x.org/wiki/) project and the
[dotXCompose](https://github.com/kragen/xcompose) project. You can add custom
rules by creating a file named `.XCompose` or `.XCompose.txt` in your
`%USERPROFILE%` folder. WinCompose must be restarted for changes to take
effect.

WinCompose stores its state in the `%APPDATA%\wincompose` folder: `settings.ini`
contains the settings, and `metadata.xml` contains all the metadata associated
with sequences.

WinCompose supports rules of more than 2 characters such as <kbd>⎄ Compose</kbd>
<kbd>(</kbd> <kbd>3</kbd> <kbd>)</kbd> for **③**.

WinCompose supports early exits. For instance, <kbd>⎄ Compose</kbd> <kbd>Q</kbd> will
immediately type **Q** because there is currently no rule starting with the capital
letter <kbd>Q</kbd>.

As of now, WinCompose is almost fully translated to Afrikaans, Belarusian, Catalan, Chinese,
Czech, Dutch, Estonian, French, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Lithuanian, Norwegian, Polish,
Portuguese, Brazilian Portuguese, Russian, Sardinian, Spanish, and Swedish. It is partially
translated to Danish, Esperanto, Finnish, Hungarian, Indonesian, Irish, Romanian, Serbian, Slovak,
and Slovenian. You can help us translate it to more languages using the Weblate project:

Development
-----------

Make sure that all Git submodules are fetched, then just open `src/wincompose.sln`
in Visual Studio in order to build WinCompose. You will also need to install
[Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) if you wish to build the installer.
